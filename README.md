##Game Summary##

1. Online Trivia Engine - Currently Branded as Historical Trivia Online. This could also be used to power a site /app that needs the ability to display trivia and collect win loss info 
2. Player begins game by clicking Start button, which enables the Reset and Submit buttons. Game controls / buttons to the left, Trivia Q & A Display on the right 
3. Player has 10 secons to select the correct answer and hit "submit" 
4. Game will track wins and losses
5. Quiz engine is extensible and new questions can be added. 
6.  Wins and Losses are tracked until Reset button clears everything
7. No persistence, user, or state tracking at present April 2019

**Release Notes:**

1. The Start button begins a game, 
2. Reset ends game and resets all variables
3. Design is deliberately simple. Intend tio build on this and create an automated quiz engine with database storage.

**Known issues:**

1. I deliberately set width of game console and don't like it when it gets below 400-500 px. Need
to revamp this and make it truly responsive.

Will research solutions for v2
